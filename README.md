# AI Question Generator

This project contains a Python script that uses a generative AI model to create new analytical and reasoning questions based on an example you provide.

## Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    You need to have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Get a Google AI API Key:**
    *   Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to get your API key.
    *   You will need a Google account.

3.  **Configure the API Key:**
    *   Open the `.env` file in this directory.
    *   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key you obtained from Google AI Studio.

## How to Run

1.  **Provide an Example Question (Optional):**
    *   Open the `question_generator.py` file.
    *   Find the `training_question` variable inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    *   You can change the text of this variable to any example question you want to use as a template.

2.  **Run the Script:**
    Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python mcq_generator.py "E:\chemisty 9\chapter 1.pdf" -d hard -o diff.txt 
    ```

The script will then print a new question generated by the AI based on the example provided.
